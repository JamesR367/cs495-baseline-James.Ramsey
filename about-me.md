#### Question 1:
Programming languages I've used are C, C++, Java, Python, and R.

#### Question 2:
I've mainly coded in classes, personal projects, and research projects. Some things I've done are the CS222 projects, a research project about looking into different data types on social media platforms, and a personal project such as creating a router from a Raspberry Pi.

#### Question 3:
The largest program I've worked with would have been the project from CS222.

#### Question 4:
I'm comfortable with most things when it comes to coding at least my ability to learn them in a reasonable amount of time.

#### Question 5:
 The only thing I'm not comfortable with are databases and I am currently in the database class so I hopefully feel more comfortable with them as the class continues.
